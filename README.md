### Softograph Phase-02 Assignment

The game description was provided. My approach is documented in the following paragraphs.

#### The demographic

My understanding from the document was that the game would be ideal as an interactive medium for teaching kids addition/subtraction. So, I took kid-friendliness as a deciding factor. The graphics and gameplay adjustments were chosen with this in mind.

#### Initial Mock-Up

I made out a rough sketch following the description provided.

#### Gameplay Adjustments

I took some liberties in tweaking some of the instructions to make it more suitable to kids.

The initial plan was to have two **Easy/Regular** difficulty modes, which I later replace with a **Timed mode**, which runs for **90 seconds**. The game is still flexible to having multiple difficulty modes with modifiable difficulty multipliers, if we feel the need to switch to that approach later.

I also made sure to have more valid pairs generated because otherwise the game does not seem fair. There is still an 8% chance to have an invalid pair to be generated. 

#### Graphic Design Decisions

I prepared two different art-styles, **Minimalistic & Flat Themed**, and **Traditional Stylized Art**.

I opted for the second one as I felt it would be more attractive toward the young consumers. The shapes of the buttons and UI elements were also decided on this factor. I tried to stick to the following simple color palette.
